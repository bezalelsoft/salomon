Sage mAker modeL cOpy froM One account to aNother

Solves everlasting issues with Amazon SageMaker:
1. Make copy of a SageMaker model from one account to another (or from one environment to another)
2. Freeze SageMaker model, so that model used for SageMaker endpoints is immutable and safe from incidental modifications by data scientists
3. Single-command operation for model copy (fills gaps present in Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
